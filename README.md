This Ui was made to show how to use my flutter package“[Firestore_indexing_search](https://pub.dev/packages/firestore_indexing_search "Firestore_indexing_search"),  It will help developers understand how to automatically index their data and how to create custom search screens. (In beta since the main package is in beta )
